# Learning Rust

In this repository, I will try to test different functionalities of the Rust programming language, as well as centralize references, such as documentations, articles or talks, which might be useful for begginers.

## Docs and Useful References

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): a book that documents and teaches how Rust works.
- [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/): documents how the Cargo package system works.
- [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html): shows how Rust documentation should be done.
