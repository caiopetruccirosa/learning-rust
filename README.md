# Learning Rust

In this repository, I will try to test different functionalities of the Rust, as well as centralize documentations useful for begginers.

## Docs and Useful Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): a book that documents and teaches how Rust works.
- [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/): documents how the Cargo package system works.
- [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html): shows how Rust documentation should be done.
- [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/): repository that holds all the documentations published along with Crate packages.
- [rust-by-example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/blob/master/src/cargo.md): a Github repository that holds examples implementing basic funcionalities of Rust.
